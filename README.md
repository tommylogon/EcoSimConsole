The basic concept is the following: 
Base entities: Workers, independents, Ships, Statiosn, outposts, stellar objects (planets and moons)

Workers will work at and be transported between locations based on preference. is akin to a low class population

indipendents should be able to traverse a virtual space and perform tasks based on preference (buy low sell high, mine, pirate, guard or work in locations). considered the mid and high class population.

Ships and outposts have basic stats: health, fuel, cargo space (goods, data or personel), combat ability, defensive ability, manuverability, crew size

Locations consume and produce goods. more workers equals more production at higher cost.

orgs, a collection of indipendents and/or workers directed by goal (take over area, resource. etc).
Example: Weapons manufacturer wants the goods to make more weapon goods, and will be agressive in aquiring them vs another org.

Visualize each entity and follow it.

Be systemic and dynamic: a chain of production, chain of progression. 
Logistics
1). Minables spawn around locations, someone find minables, either sell or claim data. (titanium ore)
2). Collect the resources, refine and produce basic refined goods. (Titanium plates)
3). Manufacture complex goods to produce new entities (Basic Outpost (Miner module/ Habitation Module/ cargo module))
